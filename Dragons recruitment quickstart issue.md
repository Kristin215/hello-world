# So you want to do some research?

## Purpose

## Type of Research ([examples](https://methods.18f.gov/))


## Recruitment criteria
* Number of participants: 
* Participant Requirements (_All or Some participants must be..._):
* MHV - to know the distinction between advanced, basic, and premium accounts
  - For example being able to know what access the Veteran has for each account
* Disability 
  - distinction between a Veteran who has never filed a claim ever vs. a Veteran who needs to file a new claim in addition to their former claims
  - service connected vs non-service connected
  - Veterans who have a disability rating vs. Veterans who do not
* VR&E - 
  - Veteran has to be 12 years removed from their active duty service
* _Indicate if you're looking for a particular age range, geographic reach, account type, or other demographics. (If nothing is indicated here, we'll strive for an even spread of ages, genders, branches of service, ethnicities, and geographic areas.)_ 

## Dates and Times You Would Like to Have Sessions
PM and mod should propose these to the recruiter. Make sure you have notetakers lined up.
Things to consider:
* When are your moderator and note-taker available? Their schedules dictate these slots.
* It's difficult for one person to moderate more than 3 hours of research in a day or 2 sessions back-to-back.
